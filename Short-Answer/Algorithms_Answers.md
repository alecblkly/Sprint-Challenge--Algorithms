## Exercise I

a) For this problem, it looks like this would be polynomial scaling O(n^2). As "n" becomes larger, the operation scales quickly per number of elements. Comparing the output graph to the complexity chart, the graph is more in-line with O(n^2); the line does grow quickly, but not as quick as O(2^n).

b) For this problem, it looks like this would be logarithmic scaling O(log n). The operations do scale as more elements are added, however; it scales by 1 operation, stays there for a few elements, and then increases.

c) For this problem, it looks like this would be linearithmic scaling O(n log n). For each iteration of this function, increases the operations by 2 while the number of elements increases by 1.
